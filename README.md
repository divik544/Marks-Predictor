# Marks Predictor
The Project aims to predict student marks using Bayesian Linear Regression. Marks are considered as continuous variable here and hence the problem can be modeled as regression problem. Total 6 features are used for prediction(out of total 33 as in dataset). The features are:

- Mother education
- Father education
- Studytime
- Previous class failures
- Higher education
- Absences

The project is built in `Python3`.

Bayesian regression is implemented using `pymc3` module. An intuitive user interface is also provided using `tkinter` module.`
